# Producing Test Specs from TestRail

This project was developed as part of the introduction of software test management tools into a pharmaceutical organisation.

The Idera owned TestRail tool is a comprehensive and well integrated application that provides cloud and server hosted access to functionality to manage the design, development, planning and execution of Tests.

Testing documentation for the client had to be in a very specific format, with a very specific workflow and sign off process.

This code was designed to extract the data from the TestRail application via it's API and produce the Test Specification in the required format.
